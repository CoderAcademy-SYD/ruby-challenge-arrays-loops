# For questions 1 and 2 below use the following array:
shopping_list = ['cheese', 'toilet paper', 'taco shells', 'sushi rolls', '3 avocados', 'soap', 'sparkling mineral water', '2 pineapples', 'toothpaste']

# 1) Use .each to loop through each item in the shopping_list and capitalise
#    all words in each item. Hint: work smarter not harder - check Stack Overflow

# 2) Use while to loop through the shopping list and divide the shopping list
#    into multiple arrays according to item type. Print all of the arrays with a divider
#    between each and a total item count for each item.

bathroom_items = []
fruit = []
dairy = []
meals = []
beverages = []

# 3) Create an array of at least 20 integers.
#       Use a for loop to:
#         - find the average of all the integers
#         - find the sum of all the integers
#         - create an array of the same values as floats
#         - create an array of values that are multiplied by a randomly generated number

# EXTENSION TASK
# Use a for loop to go through each item in the shopping_list, remove any number in the
# string and replace it with its corresponding word. For example: '3 avocados' will
# become 'three avocados'.
# Consider using RegEx.
